##### Obtain a specific instance of a data product

Download files for a single NEON data product, site, and year-month combination to obtain smaller and more specific NEON datasets. This functionality requires a product ID from step 1 or the NEON [data portal](http://data.neonscience.org/static/browse.html).

The downloads will appear in a new folder of the form **NEON\_\<site\>\_\<time range\>**, located in the **NEON Downloads** folder. These items are zipped and need to be put through step 2.

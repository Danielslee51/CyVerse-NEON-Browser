##### Obtain a specific instance of a data product

Download files for a single NEON data product, site, and year-month. A product ID from step 1 or the NEON <a href='http://data.neonscience.org/static/browse.html' target='_blank'>data portal</a> is required.

These downloads will come unzipped and stacked, meaning that they will be already opened into folders and organized based on measurement variables (see the difference by downloading directly from NEON). Due to complications with `R Shiny`'s download system, two buttons were necesary; However, only the `Download items` button needs to be clicked, as the rest is done automatically.

## Downloading a Data Product

The last step is to download the product you have found. This all occurs under the `Product Download` tab, immediately after the `Product Catalog`. These downloads are based on a Product ID, and there are two different modes for download:

1. Regular— This mode is used for normal, non-AOP downloads. This requires a Product ID and a Field Site, and dates can be selected from a table will appear for every Product ID-site combination with the available dates.
2. AOP— This mode is meant for AOP flight products. This requires a Product ID and a Field Site, and years can be selected from a table will appear for every Product ID-site combination with the available years. By nature of AOP data, this will take a very long time.

This section will explain both modes of download. Click on the tabs below to navigate through the various topics:

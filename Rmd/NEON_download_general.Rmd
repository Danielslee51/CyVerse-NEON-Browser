##### Obtain a data product in its entirety

Download NEON data products without filtering over time. This functionality requires a product ID from step 1 or the NEON [data portal](http://data.neonscience.org/static/browse.html). Optionally, one NEON site can be selected.

These downloads will come unzipped and stacked, meaning that they will be already opened into folders and organized based on measurement variables. Due to restrictions with `R Shiny`'s download system, you will need to download the products onto the app, then transfer it to your computer. Press the `Download Items` button first, then the `Transfer Downloads` button when it becomes available.

# NEON-Shiny-Browser
A multifunctional R Shiny map tool designed to make NEON data accessible, visualized, and easy to interact with.

## Overview
The NEON Shiny Browser is an interactive tool to browse, pull, and manipulate data collected by [NEON](https://www.neonscience.org/). This R Shiny app uses leaflet, NEON's own [data resources](https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-utilities/tree/master/neonUtilities), and [community compiled packages](https://github.com/ropensci/nneo) to create a comprehensive tool that allows users to do everything from browsing NEON sites, to finding and downloading and unziping data products.

### Features
First, this app displays relevant features of NEON and their research on a map. Users can view and filter map features such as NEON [sites](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites), NEON domains, [AOP](https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/airborne-remote-sensing) flightpaths, and [TOS](https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/terrestrial-organismal-sampling) locations.

Additionally, this app provides an easy, in-app alternative to NEON's [data portal](http://data.neonscience.org/browse-data). Users can view data products and their availabilities, download them in various formats, and then stack those downloads to make them more organized and accessible.

### NEON
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/"><img src = "Img/NEON.png" width=30/></a> is a "continental-scale ecological observation facility" that provides open data on our ecosystems. This 30-year project collects environmental data like precipitation, soil temperature, humidity, and pressure across 81 field sites (47 terrestrial and 34 aquatic) to measure the patterns and changes in our environment. With over 180 data products describing the characteristics of a diverse range of ecosystems, their data will be crucial to future studies of biology and climate change over time.
